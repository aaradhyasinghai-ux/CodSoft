# C++ Projects – CodSoft Internship

This repository contains **three console-based C++ projects** developed as part of my **1-Month C++ Developer Internship at CodSoft**.  
Each project focuses on strengthening core C++ concepts such as input/output handling, control structures, functions, loops, and logic building.
